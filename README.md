# NOAA Weather Data
This repo contains very simple code used to mirror weather data from NOAA for it to be used in
the [Open COVID-19 project](https://github.com/open-covid-19/data). It reproduces the last 2 years
worth of records for all active stations from the [Global Historical Climatology Network][1].
